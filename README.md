# CNC12 Update Wizard
 Windows application to "update" CNC12 to v5.4 from an older version for controls with a wizard.
 <br><br>Works with the following Boards and CNC12 versions:
 <br>Acorn v5.0+ for Mill, Lathe, Router, and Plasma
 <br>AcornSix v5.0+ for Mill, Lathe, Router, Plasma, and Laser
 <br>Hickory v5.2+ for Mill, Lathe, Router, and Plasma
 <br><br>Using this application, updating to CNC12 v5.4 takes 5 minutes or less.
 <br><br>My "update wish list" can be found in the Wiki of this repository.
